            He's my short tempered brother but truly good at heart.
            He always stand by me like an elder brother,looked out foe me no matters what.
            Bro has so many hobbies- it's just sad he doesn't put them use.
            I wish u have a great life and full of happiness with senjuti.
            I will really miss those random days when we used to hang out & travel together.
