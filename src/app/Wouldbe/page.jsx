        <p>
            What more can I say...
             This person has given me a reason to live in my life...
             The biggest crazy one has entered my life and changed everything...
             No matter what, I want to live my whole life with only him...
             Maybe Jis is the most disgusting college, but it has given me the most precious gift of my life.
            Anyway, lots of love for my love.
