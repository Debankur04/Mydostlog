        <p>
            She is my "jhallii" girl,meri devar I mean to say meri nanad.
            A pure soul, filled with innocence and deeply sensitive... 
            Her world revolves around writing great poems.
            But I wish that she moves far away from all the chaos & the family problems.
            I hope she focuses on herself and finds a real life partner who truly values her.
            May her life be filled with endless happpiness.
            Lots of love from her bhabhi.
        </p>
